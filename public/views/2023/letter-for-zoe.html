						It's so fun to imagine life alongside you and to create scenarios in my head. In every single one of them we're always together: two city rats fighting over a pizza slice, cats getting ready for work and bawling because they're late, dogs in a bakery making bread, dinosaurs searching for water, bats emerging from under a bridge, or two 8-bit characters overlooking a canyon. It's always us. 
						<br><br>
						This year has been a lot. Theres so many things that I wasn't sure were going to be possible that became possible. We just figured things out somehow. I'm always worried sick about our future and whether or not we can overcome all of the obstacles. However, throughout the year theres been so many moments that have proven to me that we can do it; we can be happy and make it. You've been there every single time, through all of the ups and downs and you've brought me comfort when I felt insecure, you gave me stability when I felt unstable, you gave me empathy when I made mistakes and you've made me a better person. I can only hope sometimes that I've provided the same presence in your life as you have for me.
						<br><br>
						You've given me life. 
						<br><br>
						You've given me strength.
						<br><br>
						You've given me the reassurance that I'm worthy of love, and for all of the things that we've seen and experienced this year, I'm still kind of pinching myself because it all feels so surreal. It's so unbelievable in the best of ways: seeing the Grand Canyon, Hiking Palo Duro, seeing the tracks at Dinosaur Valley, tubing in San Marcos, visiting the Capitol, seeing the Bats emerge from Congress Bridge, our spontaneous trip to Grapevine to see the Aquarium, and all of the random memories we made in between. 
						<br><br>
						Time warps when I sit down to think of all of these memories. I'm not afraid of the waves anymore (metaphorical we'll see if I can learn to swim in 2024 o_o). I can close my eyes, sit at the shore, and let the waves splash. It doesn't make sense to try to fight the waves, and accepting and taking comfort in the fact that they will always be there is bliss. Theres always ups and downs and waves that will splash your face, but there's also the simple pleasure of the waves that gently move alongside you.
						<br><br>
						I love you more than anything. This has been one of the happiest years of my life and I started it off bedridden and unable to even walk. Theres nothing more that I could ask for and I can think of no better gift than to be by your side throughout this journey.
