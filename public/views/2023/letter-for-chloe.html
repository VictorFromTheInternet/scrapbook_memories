					<p>
						Youre always up for a new experience or adventure and you can always appreciate the simplicity of the everyday. Hanging out with you is always a good reminder to smell the roses but to also jump into the rose bush just to experience new things (because the intrusive thoughts tell you to). 
						<br><br>
						I was kind of hesitant to visit the Renaissance faire this year, it was new to me and I wasn't sure if I'd fit to the crowd or enjoy it to it's full extent. It wasnt necessarily diving into the rose bush for me but it's definitely something that if it weren't for you and Zoe, I would've never experienced. 
						<br><br>
						I wouldve missed out on the Turkey Legs, Gems shops, Medieval Public humiliation stands (just to watch others get humiliated not myself like at the Barbarian Bombshells show 0 _o ), the Fire Whip guy, the Bird Show, and the new atmosphere; a break from the everyday.
						<br><br>
						Now it's a memory I get to recall and look back on fondly. 
						I look forward to the next adventure. Hopefully you like this token of appreciation.
