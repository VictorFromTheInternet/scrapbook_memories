						Your resolve makes you genuinely one of the strongest people that I know. You have a distinguishable
						character, and your ethic is the kinda stuff that moves mountains (no pun intended).
						<br><br>
						I didn't really know what to expect when I signed up for the half-marathon. I wasn't too confident in myself
						if I'm being completely honest. I don't think I would've signed up for a race anytime soon if it weren't for the strength that I suddenly got from you saying that youd be doing one in a couple
						weeks. I feel like I got second hand confidence and I suddenly felt like I could do something I never
						envisioned for myself in 2023. I was never really good at anything sports related and I've kind of accepted
						that. However, to me running has become a bit more than a sport, it's become a form of therapy and medium to
						experience a different state of mind.
						<br><br>
						So I think thats what really motivated me so much even if I wasnt sure if id be able to accomplish the full
						distance. It was the opportunity to share that experience with someone else.
						So to me, my mental strategy going into the race (in a runners math kind of way) was: run a 5k, enjoy the scenery, somehow run as far as i've ever run in my life before, and if i'm still alive after that, run walk or crawl
						another 5k.
						<br><br>
						Thank you for unknowingly motivating me and being a friend. Maybe one day we can torture ourselves even more and run an Ultra marathon.
